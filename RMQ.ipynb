    "# Exercise: Range Minimum Queries (RMQ)\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise explores six different approaches to solving the ***Range Minimum Queries (RMQ)*** problem, analyzing their performance based on the following metrics::\n",
    "\n",
    "* ***Querying and Preprocessing Completed Time (Run Time):*** Measures the total time taken to preprocess the data and execute queries.\n",
    "* ***Memory Usage During Preprocessing and Querying:*** Tracks the current memory usage and peak memory usage during both preprocessing and query operations.\n",
    "* ***Time Complexity of Preprocessing and Querying:*** Analyzes the theoretical time complexity of the algorithms involved in preprocessing and querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implemented approaches include:\n",
    "* ***Naive:*** A brute-force approach that iterates through the entire subarray to find the minimum.\n",
    "* ***Precomputation-based:*** Precomputes the minimum values for all possible subarrays, allowing for constant-time queries.\n",
    "* ***Block Decomposition:*** Divides the array into blocks and precomputes the minimum for each block, improving query efficiency for large arrays.\n",
    "* ***Sparse Table:*** A data structure that uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute and store minimum values for subarrays of various sizes.\n",
    "* ***Hybrid Solutions*** (Two approaches): Combine elements of block decomposition and sparse table to achieve a balance of preprocessing time and query efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All approaches are implemented on the same initial **array with a size of 2^16**, and their performance is evaluated on both this array and a larger array with **a size of 2^17**. Each approach is implemented in a separate code cell for clarity and comparison.\n"
